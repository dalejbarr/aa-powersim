#### Handling command-line input

We want to be able to call this function with various parameters (effect sizes, N) as input and store the results, and we want to do this in batch mode. It would be nice if we could specify arguments to `do_once()` that the command line so that we don't ever have to change our script.

We can run things in "batch" mode (i.e., without starting an interactive session) by using the `Rscript` program that comes with R. If you know how to get to a command line on your operating system (I'm not sure how to do this on Windows/Mac, sorry) you should be able to try it out.

The way you run a script from the command line is

```
Rscript scriptname.R arg1 arg2 arg3
```

Where `scriptname.R` is the name of your script and `argX`s are command-line arguments.

```{r command-args}

```
