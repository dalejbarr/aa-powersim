## Further reading

- How to justify your sample size [@Lakens_2022].

- My tutorial with Lisa DeBruine [@DeBruine_Barr_2021] which covers much of the same ground, but is mainly focused on *understanding* how LMEMs work

- Other articles on power in LMEMs: [@Brysbaert_Stevens_2018], [@Kumle_Vo_Draschkow_2021], [@Westfall_Kenny_Judd_2014]

- Monte Carlo simulations comparing methods for getting $p$-values: [@Luke_2017]

Check out the [online textbooks](https://psyteachr.github.io/) and resources that my group and University of Glasgow have been developing. There are great resources to learn more about data wrangling and visualization, among other things.

## R packages

- The **`{simr}`** package [@Green_2016]
- The [**`{faux}`** package](https://debruine.github.io/faux/) for factorial simulation
